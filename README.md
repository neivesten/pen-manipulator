# 3D Pen Manipulator in CtrlX PLC Engineering

This repository contains a small example project written in Structured
Text (ST) for **ctrlX PLC Engineering**.  The code simulates a simple
2â€‘D pen manipulator capable of moving along straight lines and circular
arcs.  The program demonstrates how to build basic motion blocks using
trapezoidal and circular motion profiles.

The project can be imported into a ctrlX PLC Engineering workspace.  It
is mainly intended as a learning resource, so the motion logic is kept
minimal and easy to read.
